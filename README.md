# KEPCO MPS-620M Power Supply Schematics

These are the reverse-engineered schematics for the Kepco MPS-620M power supply. The service manual available online for this power supply has a parts list but no schematics.

- **A1** 6V supply: finished
- **A2**: output terminals, controls & crowbar done, TODO meters, readout switch, mains circuits
- **A3** Â±20V supply: mostly done, TODO line voltage switch
- **A4-A7**: finished

First, the circuitry was reverse-engineered from the boards onto paper and pencil. Then I had redrawn it in KiCad, and fixed mistakes.
